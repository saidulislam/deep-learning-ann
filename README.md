Deep Learning - Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Code Template

In this project, I gave 3 examples of tabular data and apply ANN to regression and classification tasks. The 3 examples are: 
1) Predicting New York taxi fare 
2) Is the fare more or less than certain amount
3) Determine someone makes more or less than certain amount based on census data
